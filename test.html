  <h2>Brock Boeser Injured</h2>
  <p>
    Rookie <strong>Brock Boeser</strong> of the Vancouver Canucks could be done for the rest of the season due to a lower back injury. Boeser will make a full recovery in 4-6 weeks said a release from the team. The 21-year-old was hit by the New York
    Islanders Cal Clutterbuck during last night's game at Rogers Arena and fell awkwardly into the open gate of the Canucks bench, hitting his lower back against the corner of the door frame.</p>

    <h2>Jaylen Brown Injury</h2>
    <p>
      Brown lost his grip on the rim as he finished the play, falling awkwardly ''in full backflip mode'' as Kyrie Irving put it, to the court with 1:31 remaining in the period. Brown stayed down and was still for several minutes, and a stretcher was rushed
      out. But Brown was eventually able to walk slowly to the locker room on his own, and the crowd at Target Center gave him a standing ovation.
